# AirportRepo

This file includes the questions listed under documentation on the project, with screenshots of postman, MySql and the risk assessment at the bottom. I added Richard to my Jira so he should be able to view my boards and progress.


Why are we doing this?

  In order to test whether we can make an application with basic crud functionality and test it.

How I expected the challenge to go.

  I expected the challenge to go fairly smoothly as we practiced it previously.

What went well? / What didn't go as planned?

  The basic crud functionality went well and the testing of it.

  My merging with github went a little bit wrong toward the end as well as adding some of the stretch goals to my project like Lombock.

Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.

  Potentially a task that we will definitely face as a developer, not too sure.

Screenshots showing your postman requests and the output from the API.

Screenshots of your database to prove that data is being persisted.

  Below are screenshots of my postman requests and of Mysql command line showing data persisted. I coupled them together for ease of reading and to show the moving changes.

Begining with the first method addToAirport:

Then followed by the getAll method:

To show this persisted here is a screenshot from MYSQL command line:

Then followed by the getId method: 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97603706/157908093-17b817ff-f59e-4e35-a6c4-f00739de2c92.png)

Then followed by the update method:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97603706/157910100-9007a1e1-c7c8-40de-a0ea-39ff8dde2b66.png)

Then followed by delete method:

To show these changes from the delete method and update method persisted, as you can see the plane with id 2 has been changed and also the fifth plane has been removed entirely.

Below is a screenshot from the command line:

Then followed by a couple custom queries, 

find by capacity method:
